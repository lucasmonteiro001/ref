## 3 Books To Advance Your Career as a Developer
https://betterprogramming.pub/3-books-to-advance-your-career-as-a-developer-1a303b98b2e5

- Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
This book is full of insight into how processing and storing data works. It covers database topics deeply. You will learn different types of databases and their most common use cases.
- Design Patterns by the “Gang of Four”
After learning how to program and releasing multiple solutions, every developer starts observing some similarities in code. In certain cases, they would usually apply one approach. In other cases, a different common technique would be used. If you feel the same way, you have reached a turning point.
- Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz

### Single components
When designing a single software component, architects should focus on good coding and design practices. Following the horizontal axis from left to right (from specific to abstract), I find the following books to be useful for this layer (with overlay links - thanks, Jekyll!):

- Clean Code by “Uncle” Bob Martin. Good software starts with good code, and good code is clean. Here we start with the basics of naming, functions that do one thing well, and formatting.
- Refactoring by Martin Fowler. Good software doesn’t just happen - it evolves, gains entropy, and is then restructured. The book’s subtitle reveals that this is a book about design.
- Design Patterns by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides. Going ever so slightly more abstract, design patterns help us make balanced decisions on the design of our code. This title must be close to 1/2 million copies sold by now.
- Pattern-oriented Software Architecture by Buschmann et al. A close sibling to “GoF”, POSA 1 takes a slightly broader view, including some communication patterns. It’s the start of a whole series on software architecture patterns.
### Connected components
Interesting software rarely lives in isolation, so we should look at how work is broken down into pieces and how the pieces are interconnected. The following books provide architectural guidance on this layer:

- Building Microservices (a 2nd Edition is in the works) by Sam Newman is really a book about architectural trade-offs and considerations in distributed system design rather than a pitch for one specific solution. That’s why it’s a great book for architects. It’s also very accessible.
- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Neal and Mark, although also covering soft skills, dedicates the majority of the book to modularity, component-based thinking, and architectural styles. Just what an architect needs to wire things together in the right way.
- Enterprise Integration Patterns is still relevant 17 years after publication (OK, minus the funny MSMQ examples and Java 1.4) for anyone trying to connect systems without coupling them too tightly. Several modern examples are available on-line.
- Pattern-oriented Software Architecture 4—inching towards conceptual, this tome from the same “POSA” series is a tougher read, but is one of the most comprehensive references for distributed system design.
### Entire systems
Now it’s time to zoom out further and look at the system as a whole, the forest and not just the trees, so to speak. This is where we find several of the “classic” software architecture titles:
- Just Enough Software Architecture by George Fairbanks is a very approachable, yet quite comprehensive title that’ll make a good addition to any architect’s bookshelf.
- Software Systems Architecture by Nick and Eóin covers a similar scope to George with a slightly stronger emphasis on viewpoints and perspectives. Written by hands-on architects, it shares pearls of wisdom on most every page. The only suggestion for improvement would be to condense the content down a tiny bit—almost 700 pages require a lot of discipline and patience.
- Thinking in Systems—when looking at system design and behavior from a conceptual point of view, all roads lead to system thinking and complex system theory. It’s hard to pick out a single book from this field, so I recommend Donella Meadows’ book as a gateway into this topic space.
- The Model Thinker—this one should perhaps be in parenthesis. I firmly believe that model-based thinking is critical for architects and very much enjoyed Prof Page’s Coursera course. However, most of the models are mathematical, requiring some translation in your head to apply them to software systems engineering. Still, I am convinced the book will leave you with a novel attitude to systems design and decision making, so I am keeping it on the list.
### Contexts
Experienced architects know well that the story doesn’t end with being able to design entire systems. Architecture happens in context (we deal with the “non-requirements”), so understanding that context is an important skill for an architect. In fact, missing the context renders all other elements irrelevant. So, there’s one more shelf on the top:
- Technology Strategy Patterns by Eben Hewitt is a nice catalog of all the stuff that appears in consultants’ fancy slide decks that you as an architect afterwards have to deal with. So, it behooves you to understand what’s going on there.
- The Phoenix Project and it’s buddy The Unicorn Project by Gene Kim and his tribe are standard reading to better understand the interface between business and IT and what can all go wrong there.
- The Software Architect Elevator—although feeling slightly sheepish for including a second book of mine, this one deserves a spot. It gives architects a broader view of their role and impact in an organization beyond technology. It’s not very conceptual, but I am placing it on the right out of modesty.
